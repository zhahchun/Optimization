    "* A very famous optimization problem is the so-called “Stigler Diet Problem,” which was created in 1945 by American economist and Nobel laureate George Stigler.  Stigler published a paper on his study of the optimal diet, which minimizes total annual cost while meeting the recommended daily allowance (RDA)  of  several  nutrients.   In  his  paper,  Stigler  created  a  table  of  77  different  foods  (although  if you  look  at  the  data,  you’ll  note  that  one  of  the  foods  is  “Plate”...not  sure  about  that  one)  and their nutrient content for 9 nutrients:  calories, protein, calcium, iron, vitamin A, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin,  and ascorbic acid.  To make the calculations easier,  Stigler normalized the data so that the nutrients shown are the content for \\\\$1-worth of the given food.  \\\\$1 could buy you a lot more in 1945! You can find a sample of the first few rows and columns of the table below. Stigler published this paper before linear programming algorithms had been invented, but Stigler was a very intelligent man and used “trial and error, mathematical insight, and agility,” to arrive at a diet costing only \\\\$39.93 per year.  Stigler stated there was no reason to believe he had found the cheapest diet, and other combinations could prove more cost-effective.\n",
    "    * Formulate  Stigler's  diet  problem  as  a  linear  program  and  solve  it  to  find  the  actual  optimal solution.   Stigler's  original  data  is  provided  as \"stigler.csv\" on Canvas. Use the code  snippet posted on Canvas as \"stigler.jl\" to import the data into arrays that will be much easier to work with. How does your cheapest  diet  compare  in  annual  cost  to  Stigler's?   For the purposes of this exercise, a year is 365.25 days.\n",
    "    * Now suppose you wanted a diet consisting only of foods you like to eat.  Modify the stigler.csv file  by  deleting  any  rows  you  want,  leaving  only  your  favorite  foods  as  options  for  your  diet. Solve the diet problem again and compare your total annual cost to the cost you got in the previous problem.  What foods make up your optimal diet now? \n",
