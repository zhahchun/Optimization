    "* Which solver is most accurate (gets closest to the \"right\" answer)?  \n",
    "* Which is fastest (use the @time macro)? NOTE: you should notice it takes longer to solve the problem the first time you run your code, and goes much faster if you re-sovle subsequent times. The first time you run the code, the solver takes extra time to compile/\"load\" the model (it doesn't repeat the compilation step in future re-solves).\n",

    "* If there is no clear difference between the solvers, can you think of some factors that might contribute to solver speed differences? \n",

    "## Problem 2 - Airport Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "The federal government is planning to expand the Dane County Regional Airport to accomodate more flights. It takes 100 hours of labor and 500 pounds of raw material to expand the runway environment by one acre. Each additional acre of land can accomodate 5 new flights per day. It takes 250 hours of labor and 300 pounds of raw material to expand the airport terminal area by an extra 10 square feet. Each 10 square feet added can accomodate up to 100 new passengers per day. Each flight nets a profit of \\\\$1000, and each passenger nets a profit of \\\\$50. The government requires that at least 15 new flights can be added per day. There are 1000 hours of labor and 3000 pounds of raw material available for airport expansion. \n",
    "\n",
    "(a)  Formulate a linear program (i.e., write a mathematical model using appropriate notation) to help the government plan the airport expansion to maximize profit. State the math model, then code and solve the model using Julia. (Hint: you should have two decision variables). You may type your math model in Markdown or handwrite it, upload it, and embed it as an image in your notebook file.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b)  Code the same model once again, this time separating the parameters from the solution as we did in class (see Top Brass examples).  Confirm that you obtain the same solution as in part (a).  \n",
    "\n",
    "(c)  Solve  the  problem  graphically  by  plotting  the  feasible  set  and  at least two isocost lines for the objective function.  Confirm that you obtain the same solution as in the previous parts. You may do this by hand or using a graphing calculator (e.g., Desmos), but make sure you label your constraints and isocost line clearly. You may save your soluion as an image file and embed it in your notebook file.\n",

    "## Problem 3 - Craft Beer\n",
    "\n",
    "A local microbrewery is planning operations for the summer season. They are brewing 25 different rotational beers this season in 5 different locations. During the summer, the brewery has 70,000 total hours of tank fermentation time available across the locations. Because of the slight differences in equipment at each brewing location, the cost of producing a keg of beer differs at each location. The time and cost for each brewery are given in the .csv file \"brewery_data.csv.\" A sample of the data is given in the table below. There is a minimum number of kegs required for each type of beer, also given in the .csv file. \n",

    "\n",
    "(a) Formulate a linear program (i.e., write a mathematical model using appropriate notation) to help the microbrewery minimize cost of meeting demand for each type of beer. Give a general form (parameters only -- no numbers) of the math model. You may type your math model in Markdown or handwrite it, upload it, and embed it as an image in your notebook file.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Implement and solve this instance of the model in Julia/JuMP.  Display the optimal objective value and the optimal solution (variable values).\n"
