    "In this project, the problem we would tackle is the timetabling problem, more specifically, the university course timetabling problem. We will first nail down the scope of the problem we want to address, then we will discuss the corresponding data generation. With the data in hand, we will create our model step by step, with each iteration handling more constraints within our problem scope. Lastly, we will discuss the result of our model, and some improvements we think that can be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Timetabling problems](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jisys-2022-0003/html) are a specific type of scheduling problem that manages assignments of events into timeslots. These assignments could be subject to a number of hard and soft requirements, the goal is to find a valid assignment that satisfies all hard-requirements while satisfying as much of the soft-requirements as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recent Olympic Games is an excellent example of a particularly challenging timetabling problem, with a variety of constraints, such as time, venue, personnel, and transportation. Aside from sporting events, there are many other variations and applications of this problem across different fields, such as airport slot-scheduling, logistical scheduling, shift management, and university timetabling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these problems, the field we feel that is most applicable to us is [university timetabling](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/6617177), which could be divided into examination timetabling and course timetabling problems, we chose to address the instructor allocation variation of the University Course Timetabling Problem (UCTP).\n",
    "\n",
    "The premise of the problem we chose is as follows: We are designing a weekly schedule for the classes of an educational institution, for each class there are a number of subjects that all have a fixed number of periods required each week. Each class is assigned an instructor for a specific subject, and each instructor could be responsible for more than one class. The goal is to create a schedule that has no conflict for the classes and the instructors, there could also be some kind of preference that we need to try to satisfy while maintaining a valid schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our problem, we set the size of each parameter as follows: the number of timeslots each day is four, the subjects are only held in the five weekdays, there are two classes we are scheduling for, all having seven subjects to cover, one to two instructor is available for each subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also setup some additional requirements, some instructor might be unavailable for certain timeslots, and some subjects might be limited to be held in certain timeslots. Some kind of preference for the schedule is also needed, drawing from our own experience, multiple periods of the same subject in a single day is generally disliked, so this is the trait that we choose to minimize.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the capability of our model, suitable data is needed. Because the size of the required data is not exceptionally large, we chose to handcraft the data.\n"

    "## 2. Mathematical model ##\n",
    "\n",
    "To start building our model, we first consider the simplest case, where there is no additional requirements, in other words, how do we assign instructors such that each class has exactly the number of required periods for all the subjects while avoiding any conflict in our schedule, such as instructors assigned to two classes at the same time, or a class assigned two subjects at the same time. Another constraint to consider is that instructor not assigned to a class should not have any subject scheduled for that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need the total number of periods for each subject across all periods and weekdays to be equal to the required amount, the total number of classes each instructor is assigned to for each period is smaller or equal to one, the total number of subjects each class is scheduled for each periods is smaller or equal to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limiting instructors to not be assigned to the wrong class is a bit tricky, we achieve this by having a binary data representing if each instructor is assigned to one of the classes, and limiting the total number of periods the instructor is assigned to this class to be less than or equal this data multiplied by the total number of possible periods. This way any assignment to wrong class would not happen, and any assignment to the correct class would not be blocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can tackle the task of modeling the additional requirements, which is limiting some instructors to not be assigned on certain time, and some classes must be assigned to certain times.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this we create another binary data representing if a subject can occur on a certain period for each class, this value is set to one by default, but changes to zero if the corresponding instructor is not available at this period or this class is mandated to be held at other periods. For each period since there could only be one subject assigned to it, we just need to limit the total assigned period at this period for each subject (which will be either zero or one) to be less than or equal to this binary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last problem to solve is the preference, which will become our objective function. We want to somehow penalize having more than one of each subject assigned to a single weekday, a simple way is to add the number of times each subject is assigned for each weekday, but this basically also penalize having one period assigned, which is not correct. We could subtract this value by one and clamp it to be non-negative, the obvious way to do this is with a max function, but this cannot directly be done in a linear formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution we came up with is to have a penalty variable for each class’s subject at each weekday and limit this variable to be the previously mentioned sum of occurrence minus one. But we also limit this variable to always be greater or equal to zero. Since we are ultimately minimizing this variable, any choice that is unnecessarily large would always be suboptimal, so it would always be optimized to be as close to the value we want to represent the penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now finally formulate our problem as follows:\n",
