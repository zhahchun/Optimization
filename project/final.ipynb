    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project addresses the university course timetabling problem, a specific scheduling issue where courses must be assigned to timeslots while meeting various constraints. The goal is to develop a model that creates a conflict-free schedule for classes and instructors while accommodating preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Timetabling problems](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jisys-2022-0003/html) involve organizing events into timeslots under numerous hard and soft requirements. The objective is to find a schedule that meets all hard constraints and maximizes the satisfaction of soft constraints. These problems appear in various fields, including airport slot scheduling, logistics, shift management, and university timetabling. A notable example is the recent Olympic Games, which required intricate scheduling due to constraints like time, venue, personnel, and transportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on [university timetabling](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/6617177), specifically the instructor allocation variation of the University Course Timetabling Problem (UCTP). Our task is to design a weekly schedule for classes at an educational institution. Each class has several subjects with a fixed number of periods per week, and each subject is assigned to an instructor who may teach multiple classes. The challenge is to create a conflict-free schedule that also respects instructor availability and subject-specific timeslot preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our model, the parameters are as follows:\n",
    "* Four timeslots per day\n",
    "* Classes held only on weekdays\n",
    "* Two classes, each with seven subjects\n",
    "* One to two instructors available per subject\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional constraints include:\n",
    "* Instructor availability during specific timeslots\n",
    "* Subject-specific timeslot limitations\n",
    "* Minimizing multiple periods of the same subject in a single day, based on common preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "To validate our model, we generated suitable data. Given the manageable size, we handcrafted the data to meet our requirements. Our approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of the university course timetabling problem and provides a structured method to address it. The assumptions made, such as fixed timeslots and handcrafted data, simplify the problem while still presenting a realistic scenario for testing our model."

    "## 2. Mathematical model\n",
    "\n",
    "To build our model, we first consider the simplest case with no additional requirements. Our goal is to assign instructors such that each class has the required number of periods for all subjects while avoiding any scheduling conflicts, such as an instructor being assigned to two classes at the same time or a class being assigned two subjects simultaneously. Additionally, instructors not assigned to a class should not have any subjects scheduled for that class.\n",

    "This report addresses the common scheduling problem in an academic setting by developing a mathematical model with constraints that reflect all potential scheduling conflicts. By incorporating these constraints, we successfully generated valid schedules. Additionally, we enhanced the model with variables representing preferences, allowing it to minimize undesirable traits while maintaining valid schedules.\r\n",

    "- **Validity**: The model effectively generated conflict-free schedules.\r\n",
    "- **Preference Handling**: By incorporating penalty variables, the model minimized scheduling conflicts and spread subjects evenly across the week.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Future Directions\r\n",
    "A promising future direction would be to develop a more complex objective function to accommodate a broader range of scheduling preferences. For instance, in our generated schedule, some instructors are \"overworked\" because they are available for more subjects. A composite objective function could balance workload distribution among instructors and address multiple preferences simultaneously. This improvement would make the scheduling model more robust and adaptable to various academic settings."
