    "## Problem 1 -- Machine Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following machine scheduling problem (MSP).  We have a set $M = \\{1, 2, \\ldots ,m\\}$ of machines and a set $N = \\{1, 2, \\ldots ,n\\}$ of jobs that must be performed on the machines.  Each machine $i$ has a capacity of $b_i$ units of work, and each job $j$ requires $a_{ij}$ units of work to be completed if it is scheduled on machine $i$.  All jobs must be assigned to exactly one machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Suppose that there is a cost $c_{ij}$ for scheduling job $j \\in N$ on machine $i \\in M$.  There is also fixed cost of operating a machine -- that is, in order to schedule any jobs to run on machine $i \\in M$, then you must pay a fixed cost of $h_i$.  Write an integer programming model to determine a least cost assignment of jobs to machines not exceeding the machine capacities in this case.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Modify your answer to (a) to handle the following logical condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you operate at least 3 of the first 10 machines, and you operate at least 3 of the second 10 machines, then you must operate at most 2 of the last 10 machines.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Now suppose that each job $j \\in N$ has a duration (or length) $d_j$. The _makespan_ of a schedule is the length of time it takes to finish all the jobs.  You may remove the conditions imposed in (b). Formulate a model that will minimize the makespan of an assignment of jobs to machines not exceeding the machine capacities, and ensuring that you do not operate more than half (15) of the machines.  There is no longer a fixed or variable cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) For each of the above problems/modifications, we will test different MIP solvers to see the effect on solution time.  For a variety of different MIP solvers (at least two; e.g., Gurobi and Cbc or HiGHS) of your choosing, solve (a), (b), and (c).\n",
    "\n",
    "Report the CPU time and any other observations you make for at least 2 different MIP solvers.What MIP solver did you find most effective? (There isn't a \"right answer\" here; many factors impace MIP solvers, including how you build your model.) \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the code snippet below to generate the instance data for this problem.\n"
