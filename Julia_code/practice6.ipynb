    "## Problem 1 -- Machine Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following machine scheduling problem (MSP).  We have a set $M = \\{1, 2, \\ldots ,m\\}$ of machines and a set $N = \\{1, 2, \\ldots ,n\\}$ of jobs that must be performed on the machines.  Each machine $i$ has a capacity of $b_i$ units of work, and each job $j$ requires $a_{ij}$ units of work to be completed if it is scheduled on machine $i$.  All jobs must be assigned to exactly one machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Suppose that there is a cost $c_{ij}$ for scheduling job $j \\in N$ on machine $i \\in M$.  There is also fixed cost of operating a machine -- that is, in order to schedule any jobs to run on machine $i \\in M$, then you must pay a fixed cost of $h_i$.  Write an integer programming model to determine a least cost assignment of jobs to machines not exceeding the machine capacities in this case.  \n"

    "Testing Gurobi and Cbc solvers revealed significant differences in solution times. Gurobi consistently outperformed Cbc, solving problems much faster, while Cbc was 10-20 times slower, despite using less memory. Overall, Gurobi proved to be the most effective solver. However, Cbc remains a viable option for smaller problems or when a commercial solver is unavailable."
