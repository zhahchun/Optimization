    "* In the ShoeCo example, you are asked to evaluate the solution and identify any problem(s) with it. Do you believe there's anything wrong with the solution? If so, what? How might you suggest fixing that issue (don't worry about following linear programming rules to answer this)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "There were fractional employees! Obviously we can't hire \"half a person.\" How could we solve it? We could make all employee variables integer. Or, we could decide that we want to hire part-time employees to make up the fractional portions of our solution. Or you might have a more creative idea!\n",

    "* In Lecture 3, we define the concept of \"bipartite graphs.\" Is the second graph given on that slide bipartite?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer: \n",
    "\n",
    "No. The graph shown on the slide is not bipartite. To see this, try coloring node 1 \"red.\" Then all nodes adjacent to node 1 (3, 6) are \"blue.\" Nodes adjacent to 3 and 6 (2, 5, 7, 8) must all be \"red.\" But 7 and 8 are adjacent, so they cannot both be red. Therefore, it is not possible to create a partition where no nodes in the same set are adjacent. This is the result of the 3 nodes 6, 7, and 8 all being connected to each other. If we ignore the directions of the arrows (so imagine all edges instead of arcs), we call this set of three nodes an \"odd cycle\" (a cycle of nodes with an odd number of edges) or a \"clique\" (all nodes connected to each other).\n",

    "There are many correct answers to this question. One possible matching is the following set of edges: {(0,1), (7,8), (2,3), (6,5)}. This is not a perfect matching because node 4 does not have any edges of the matching incident upon it.\n",

    "Suppose you are an optimization expert working for popular plushie manufacturer, Assemble-an-Animal. You have been tasked with figuring out how to distribute plushies. You have a total of 160 orders, which you are shipping from the manufacturing site to four different warehouses in Milwaukee, Paris, Sydney, and New Delhi. The plushies will then be shipped to three different distribution centers in Amsterdam, London, and Beijing. Each warehouse can hold a maximum number of orders (shown in table below). The plushies can either be flown to the distribution centers or taken by train. Because of travel distance restrictions, your deliveries must abide by the following rules:\n",
    "* Milwaukee can only deliver to Amsterdam and London and only by air.\n",
    "* Paris can deliver to Amsterdam and London by air or rail and Beijing by air.\n",
    "* Sydney can only deliver to Beijing, and only by air.\n",

    "Costs of rail and air transport per order are in the table below.\n",

    "The contract you have with the airline company requires that any single shipment contains no more than 45 orders. The only restriction on rail transport is that no more than 60 orders can fit on a single shipment.\n",
